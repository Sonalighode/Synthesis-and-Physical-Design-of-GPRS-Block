<h1> Synthesis and Physical Design of GPRS Block </h1>

<h2> Introduction </h2>

Performing the synthesis and physical design steps for the General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) block used for data seurity.

- Process: 32nm (saed32)
- Voltage: 0.95V (ss0p95v)
- Temperature: 125Â°C (125c)

- HVT, LVT, RVT standard cell libraries
- Low power SRAM library
- NDM library

<h2> Synthesis </h2>

- Setting the link library and target library.
- Analysing and reading the RTL.
- Elborating
- Writing timing constraints.
- Mapping and optimization
- Performing the synthesis.
- Analysing the area, power and timing reports.
- Saving the netlist.

<h3> Elaborated design obtained </h3>

<h2> Physical design </h2>

- Floorplanning
- Placement
- CTS
- Routing
- DRC, LVS checks

<h3> Floorplanning </h3>
- Setting path, setting the link and target libraries.
- Reading netlist and sdc file
  
- Horizontal layers : M1, M3, M5, M7, M9.
- Vertical layers: M2, M4, M6, M8
- Creating Core and die area, uitilisation = 0.7.
- Providing offset of 5 for the.

- Port plaement

  Placing the ports between core area and die area with M5 and M6 layers.

- Macro placement

  Placing the macros with 10u spacing and outer keepout margins with offset values of 1.

- Power planning

  - Removing the existing pattern
  - Creating vss, vdd, gnd
  - Creating rings, vias
  - Establishing connections between maros and rings
  - Creating power grids
  - Connecting the standard cells to the grids

<h3> Placement </h3>

Fixing the macros, setting the local cell density value to 0.7, setting the fanout limit to 20, setting the minimum layer as M2 and maximum as M6.

<h3> Clock Tree Synthesis </h3>

Setting the driving clocks, target skew to 0.05, selecting the invertors and buffers, building and optimizing the clock tree and hence observing the clock tree graph.
